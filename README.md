## Quick Sort
This algo uses the partition algorithm and in the first iteration passes the last element of the array as the pivot which in turn partitions the array and also determines the position of the pivot element 
Then we recursively send the last element of the partitioned array before the pivot and same is for partitioned array after the pivot 
This in turn makes each partitioned array sorted and hence we get the sorted array
